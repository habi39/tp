## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/TITLE`, `n/TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `n/eat dinner`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/TITLE [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/TITLE set/DEADLINE`, `set/DEADLINE n/TITLE` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last
  occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `n/first task n/second task`, only `n/second task` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`)
  will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
